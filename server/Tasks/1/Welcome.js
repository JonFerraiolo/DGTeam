        <p>If you drop a small pebble into a still body of water, the pebble will create circular ripples that travel far from the spot where the pebble was dropped. This effect also applies to our own actions. Everything we do in life has a ripple effect on the lives of the people around us. For example, scientific studies claim that smiles are contagious.</p>

        <p>Trust is also contagious. If you have mutual trust with two people, A and B, then A and B might deem each other as generally trustworthy based on observed interactions with you, and this could result in a new sense of mutual trust between A and B. Also, person C might admire the trust relationship between you, A and B, and then might see personal advantage to earning your trust. </p>

        <p>The goal of the Democracy Guardians Team is to marry the passion of individuals with the latest technologies to increase trust around the world. Subsequent pages will explain why trust is essential to society and how exactly your contributions to the the Democracy Guardians Team will help increase the level of trust in the world.</p>
