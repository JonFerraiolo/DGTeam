        <p>Every member of the Democracy Guardians team must have a complete and up to date profile that contains all relevant information for others to judge your personal trustworthiness. This task will step you through the process of creating an initial profile.</p>

        <p>You can (and should) update your profile whenever relevant changes occur or if you remember something pertinent that you previously had omitted. You can update your profile at any time by pressing the "Me" icon on the top menu.</p>

        <p>Note that many people and organizations outside of Democracy Guardians will also get profiles. Profiles contain the raw information that team members use to ultimately judge the trustworthiness of people and organizations.</p>

        <p>Press "Next" to begin filling out your profile.</p>
